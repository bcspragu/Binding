  "My art lineage is almost non-existent. Both of my parents work simple, blue-color jobs, and neither has any particular interest in any art forms. They hardly even watch movies. My taste in art has grown organically, almost entirely out of my love for computers. The digital, deterministic-ness of technology has always pacified me, and it is a limitlessly expressful medium.",
  "I find nothing more relaxing than sitting down at my computer and making a website or expressing myself with code. Being able to bring an idea to life is incredibly gratifying.",
  "When I was 15, I wanted to build something. I had an idea for an electrical door lock, and it could only be opened by a pattern swiped through a laser beam. I had no idea what I was doing. I'd only torn things apart before, I had never put something together. So I bought all the pieces and wrote the programs and drilled and glued and stapled until I had what I wanted.",
  "That moment between nonexistence and creation occured at the literal speed of light. I flipped the switch, and watched as all of the parts I had cobbled together came to life. Lasers lit up and recognized patterns, motors whirred, and the project was completed. The surprising thing I learned about myself was that I could bring things to life."
